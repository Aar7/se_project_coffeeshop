# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transforms

## Plan on improving the project

- Have a side menu that follows the user with the links from the top-navbar
- The link to book a table can follow the user across the page
- The recipes page can be made separate from index.html with a navbar link to more recipes than are shown
